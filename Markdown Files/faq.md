# Alchemancy
### What are your future plans for Alchemancy?
A dedicated digital client is planned though I don't have a release date yet. My focus is on building a competitive multiplayer experience with matchmaking and periodic tournaments. Realistically this will be all that I can afford but I do have dreams of making a single player story mode, unique draft mode, and gamemodes for 3-4 players.

### Do you use AI in your art and why do you hate artists?
All card art is currently AI generated as that is what I can afford right now. It's that or I draw them myself but nobody wants that, trust me. While I respect the immense struggles artists are going through right now with AI art, this game wouldn't exist without it. I plan to gradually upgrade my art with real artists' work as the game brings in some cash. 

### What will monetization look like?
This game will be free to play first. Anything requiring money from players will come with art made from real artists. I don't mind if this game never makes a profit but I do want it to be sustainable enough that I can release new card sets without having to sell my second child (first one is already spoken for). 

Cards will be earned over time in the free to play model but you will also be able to outright buy all cards in the game (present and future) for a single price. I am not a fan of CCG models and just want players to be able to start playing the game without having to worry about dropping $100's of dollars on card packs. A large part of my planned monetization model is inspired by one of favourite games, Smite. I think they did a great job balancing ftp and paid models and I want to mimic that.

### How can I support the game?
I'm not taking any donations at this time. Keep a look out for a Kickstarter once I have something more concrete to show of a digital client. But until then I will take any words of encouragement or feedback you have! The main place you can contact me is @Moonfassa on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HWGFe7tPyZ).

### Where can I find people to play with?
Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HWGFe7tPyZ) and ping the @looking-for-game role. The community is small right now so be patient if nobody is available. I'm often around on weekends to play (PST time zone) so feel free to ping @Moonfassa as well.

### My cards are not loading or updating properly in Tabletop Simulator
Try turning off mod caching (under settings), then closing TTS and reloading into the mod. Once you have the updated images, you can turn it back on for faster loading times.

### How do I keep track of modified cards in hand/deck like Wog Wisdom?
Right click the coloured buttons on the 4 corners of the card's image to give negative values. Use these to keep track of cost reduction, stat increases, etc. Card buttons will not work if you are shuffling the card back into your deck. Right click the card, then edit the description at the bottom instead.
